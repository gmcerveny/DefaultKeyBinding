This is my default keybindings for OS X. 

Info on keybinds at ADC's [Text Defaults Bindings](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/cocoa/conceptual/eventoverview/TextDefaultsBindings/TextDefaultsBindings.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000468-CJBDEADF).

> These notes do apply to Cocoa applications such as Xcode, Interface Builder, TextEdit, and others which use the text system.

This maybe interesting to add as well [Emacs Opt Keybindings](http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~jrus/Site/KeyBindings/Emacs%20Opt%20Bindings.dict ) with writeup at [Cocoa Text System](http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~jrus/Site/Cocoa%20Text%20System.html).
